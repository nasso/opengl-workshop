# Clearing the screen

Right now, your window probably doesn't show anything exciting yet. Let's change
that!

Use [`glClear`] and [`glClearColor`] to clear the framebuffer of your window
using the colour of your choice! Do it in the `render` function callback to
clear the screen every time before anything gets drawn.
